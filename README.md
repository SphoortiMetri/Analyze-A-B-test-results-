# Analyze_A/B_test_results

This project focuses on analyzing results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. 
A company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. 
Should the company implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision?
